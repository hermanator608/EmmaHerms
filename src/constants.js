export const AboutMe = 'During my undergraduate studies I worked on a behavioral health inpatient unit to explore my interests in clinical psychology. My responsibilities were to check vitals, assist with activities of daily living (ADLs), and monitor safety. However, the insight I gained was far beyond the scope of these tasks. One instance a patient was placed in a safe room for being a potential threat to himself or others. On my rounds I noticed he seemed frightened and was unwilling to answer any questions. Instead of continuing my rounds, I handed him a piece of paper and pencil. Immediately he started communicating with me through this medium. It turned out he was experiencing psychosis and was unaware of his location. For the rest of his stay he felt comfortable asking me for help because I took the time to understand what he was experiencing. It became clear to me that although institutions may be attempting to support individuals with severe mental illness (SMI), they may not be implementing the best practices to do so. I continued to work in clinical settings, which brought up many questions regarding my patients’ illnesses. For example, what neurological mechanisms underly psychosis symptoms? What is the system-level effect of antipsychotic medication? What factors contribute to treatment response and can we predict these outcomes? I believe careful research could elucidate these questions to advance assessment and treatment for those experiencing SMI.'

  thesis: 'Thesis: Effect of alcohol on ad libitum eating: The role of food related reward and inhibitory control',
  content: 'I completed my MA degree at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Dr. Harriet de Witt. The central goal of my research was to understand why alcohol increases food consumption. Following an alcohol or placebo beverage, participants completed an inhibition task (a cued go/no-go task) and had the opportunity to consume snacks. Results indicated alcohol increased the number of inhibitory failures on the cued go/no-go task, which was positively associated with increased food intake. This suggests inhibitory control mediates the relationship between alcohol and food consumption. I completed analyses and created graphs for my thesis using R. Findings from the study were presented at the Society for Biological Psychiatry conference this past May.',

  thesis: 'Honors Thesis: Effects of stigma surrounding mental health on attitudes toward seeking treatment',
  content: 'Through the Psychology Honors Program, at the University of Wisconsin – La Crosse, I was immersed in every step of the research process: from writing a grant to completing analyses in SPSS. I was awarded a Research and Creativity grant for my thesis assessing stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental illness. Results indicated that exposure to individuals talking about their experience with mental illness decreased the stigma associated with seeking treatment. I enjoyed conducting research and pursued an assistant position under Dr. Alessandro Quartiroli and Dr. Mark Kayson. We used EEG to identify changes in alpha waves following brainwave entrainment. This was my first experience collecting neurophysiological data and I was extremely motivated to learn more. I knew EEG and other advanced measures of neural activity would help me address questions pertaining to the etiology of SMI. This led me to apply to MA programs in order to elevate my research background.',
